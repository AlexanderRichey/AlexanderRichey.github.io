# My Website

This repository holds my website, which is a personal blog about politics, culture, and code.

## Website Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this website:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
* The theme is called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
* Developed on GitHub (with a little help from Lande's [blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)) and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Thanks for reading!

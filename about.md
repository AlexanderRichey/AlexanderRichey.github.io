---

I'm currently a student at [a/A](http://appacademy.io/) in NYC, formally a graduate student in philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/student/alexander-richey), and an undergrad at [N.Y.U.](http://nyu.edu/) before that. This blog is mainly a repository for my published writing, which is mostly about politics, culture, and code. Connect below!

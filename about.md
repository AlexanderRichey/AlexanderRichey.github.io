I'm a web developer in NYC, formerly a graduate student in philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/), and an undergrad at [N.Y.U.](http://nyu.edu/) before that. This blog is mainly a repository for my published writing, which is mostly about politics, culture, and code. You can also check out some of my web development work in my [portfolio](/dev/index.html). Connect below!

I'm a web developer in NYC, formerly a graduate student in philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/), and an undergrad at [N.Y.U.](http://nyu.edu/) before that. This blog is mainly a repository for my published writing, which is mostly about politics, culture, and code. You can also check out some of my web development work in my [portfolio](/dev/index.html). Connect below!

Some fun facts about the setup of this website:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* The theme is called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), which is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) and made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
* Developed on GitHub (with a little help from Lande's [blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)) and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

Here's the abstract:</p><blockquote><p>In this paper, I exposit Ted Sider’s proposed solution to the problem of radical semantic skepticism, as it is presented in his <em>Writing the Book of the World</em>, and argue that it does not succeed. I begin with an exposition of the problem of radical semantic skepticism, then offer one solution to the problem and a subsequent modification to this solution. Next, in a brief interlude, I roughly characterize Sider’s notion of “structure” – whose exposition and defense is the primary aim of his book – and then turn to its application to the skeptical problem. There I pose an objection to it, which, I believe, ultimately causes Sider’s proposal to fail and compromises the larger agenda of his book.</p></blockquote></div></article></main><footer><small>© 2021.

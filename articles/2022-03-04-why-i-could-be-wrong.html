I do not. My position is that there's always a possibility that, for almost anything I currently believe, it could be false.</p><p>I apply this position wholesale, across nearly all domains. In the next few paragraphs, I'd like to explain why I take this view and to discuss some of its implications, the main one being intellectual humility.</p><h2>The Argument</h2><p>In order to setup my argument, I need to define a few terms. The first definition, where the letter "p" stands for any complete sentence, is</p><blockquote><p><strong>Certainty:</strong> If I am certain that p, then (1) that p must be true, (2) I believe that p, and (3) my belief in that p must be veridical.</p></blockquote><p>Let me explain why I've defined certainty this way by arguing in favor of (1), (2), and (3) in order.</p><p>I think that (1) is the least controversial component of my definition, since it describes the usual way the word "certainty" is used. (1) simply states that whatever it is one is certain of, it must be true.</p><p>(2) describes a doxastic aspect of <em>certainty.</em> <em>Doxastic</em> means <em>of or relating to one's beliefs.</em> It says that, if I'm certain that p, then I believe that p. This too seems to describe the usual way the word "certainty" is used. To say otherwise would, I think, lead to incoherence. Consider this example to see how: Suppose I say,</p><blockquote><p>I'm certain that p.</p></blockquote><p>And someone then asks,</p><blockquote><p>Do you believe that p?</p></blockquote><p>If I were to answer <em>no,</em> then it seems to me that I would be incoherent. It would not make sense to say, on any plausible interpretation of <em>certainty,</em> that, while I do not believe that p, I'm certain that p. I think this is enough to show that, on the basis of common understanding of the word "certainty," being certain that p entails that I believe that p.</p><p>The final component of my definition, (3), says that my belief in that p must be veridical. That is, my belief in that p must truly "reflect" or "correspond to" or "coincide with" reality. What I take this to mean, truth-functionally, is that my belief in any proposition p is veridical just when I believe that p and that p obtains. Therefore, if I believe that p and p, it then follows trivially that my belief is veridical. This claim is actually a theorem that is susceptible to logical formulation and derivation. Let B, P, and V stand for the sentences "I believe p," "p," and "My belief in p is veridical," respectively.</p><ol><li>(B ∧ P) ⟷ V (definition)</li><li>B (assume)</li><li>P (assume)</li></ol><p>Therefore,</p><ol start=4><li>V (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconditional_elimination>bi-conditional elimination</a> by 1, 2, and 3)</li></ol><p>Leaving the formalism aside, I think that one can grasp this interpretation of veridicality intuitively. If my belief in that p is veridical just when that p obtains and I believe it, and we've already stipulated that, in all cases of certainty, that p does obtain and I do believe it, then, obviously, my belief <em>must</em> be veridical, since there's no possible case where it couldn't be.</p><p>The next concept I'd like to setup is what <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-sem-challenge/#WhatMetaReal>philosophers call</a> <em>realism,</em> which consists of the following two claims:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Existence:</strong> For any realist domain, the objects and relations of which it is composed exist.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Independence:</strong> For any realist domain, it is independent of minds, languages, theories, concepts, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Basically, when I say of some domain that it's <em>real,</em> what I mean is that it is the way it is regardless of what I think about it or what language I use to express facts about it. For example, two plus two is four even if I mistakenly think it's three. My thinking that the answer is three doesn't make it the case that it is three; it just makes me wrong.</p><p>The language I choose to use can make a difference in the way I express facts, but it doesn't change the underlying facts themselves. For example, in binary, one plus one is ten, and not two. But whether I express myself in binary or decimal does not affect the fact in question, namely that one plus one is two in decimal and ten in binary. Such facts are, in this way, mind and language independent.</p><p>Similar remarks apply to the claim that George Washington was the first president of the United States of America or that the speed of light is one hundred eighty-six thousand miles per second. These facts are as they are regardless of my mental attitude toward them, or whatever language, theory, or concept I use to express them.</p><p>Not all domains are <em>"real"</em> in this sense. My taste in beer, for example, isn't <em>independent</em> of my own mind. In fact, it <em>just is</em> what I think about it or what I experience it to be. This is in part because I have direct epistemic access to my own mind, my own experiences and thoughts, or at least to some of them.</p><p><em>Realism</em> implies that, for any domain that I'm a realist about, I could be wrong about it. The primary reason for this is <em>independence.</em> Unlike the facts about my taste in beer, the facts of any realist domain are independent of what I think about them. I don't have direct access to these facts and so my beliefs about them may fail to reflect the truth. The reason for this is that, unlike the cases of my own experiences and thoughts, there are possibilities that I cannot rule out. For example, I could be misremembering; I may have made a simple mistake; there could be something affecting my perception, like a thorn in my eye obscuring my view; or, more remotely, I could be dreaming right now; I could be a brain in a vat.</p><p>The more remote of these possibilities do not personally trouble me. But the nearer possibilities do. I suspect that most everyone has had an experience of misremembering something, of making a mistake when doing a computation, of seeing one thing at a distance and discovering later, when up close, that it is another.</p><p>Here's the argument:</p><ol><li>By <em>certainty,</em> if I am certain that p, then my belief in that p must be veridical.</li><li>By <em>realism,</em> my belief in that p could fail to be veridical.</li><li>Therefore, by <em><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens>modus tollens</a>,</em> I'm not certain that p.</li></ol><p>This argument says that I cannot be certain about anything about any realist domain. Realist domains, in my opinion, include math, physics, biology, logic, sociology, history, and more.</p><p>Is this conclusion too strong? I, for my part, don't think so. It is a commonplace in the sciences that our best theories of the world could be overturned in light of new evidence. We can attain <em>confidence</em> in our theories; we can believe very probably that we're right, but the probability is never exactly one. Certainty, I believe, is out of reach.</p><h2>Degrees of Belief</h2><p>In Tolstoy's novel <em>War and Peace,</em> <a href=http://www.literaturepage.com/read/warandpeace-479.html>he writes</a>,</p><blockquote><p>All we can know is that we know nothing. And that's the height of human wisdom.</p></blockquote><p>The position I've just argued for sounds dangerously similar to this quip. It sounds as if I'm saying that I'm certain that I can't be certain, which would be a contradiction. My position, correctly stated, however, is not that I'm certain that I can't be certain of anything. It's that I <em>believe</em> I can't be certain of anything.</p><p>The meaning of the term "believe," in this context, deserves a bit of clarification.</p><p>In a word, I judge various claims to be true or false and I hold some claims with more confidence than others. More specifically, for any claim that I'm competent enough to evaluate, I have some degree of confidence in it. I'm very confident in some statements, like <em>one plus one is two</em>, for example — such a claim is as close an approximation of certainty as one could hope for. But there are other statements, at the other end of the spectrum, that I believe to be true but which I'm not so confident about, such as the claim that <em>there isn't an afterlife.</em> I come down, on that particular question, saying <em>yes,</em> but I'm not very confident that this belief is true. I don't really know.</p><p>When I say that I believe I can't be certain of anything, I am expressing a certain confidence in the proposition. I am expressing a positive epistemic attitude toward it, but I am not expressing full certainty in it.</p><p>In fact, I think it is this nuanced weighing of beliefs that, in large part, produces my understanding of the world.</p><h2>Objections</h2><p>Is the position I've just argued for coherent? To be clear about it, my position is this:</p><blockquote><p>For anything I believe about any realist domain, my belief could fail to be veridical.</p></blockquote><p>Does this position refute itself? It sounds like it could. Here's what I come up with when I try to apply the position to itself, while stripping out all the qualifiers to make it easier to read:</p><blockquote><p>My belief that, for anything I believe, it could be false, could be false.</p></blockquote><p>This is coherent, if a bit repetitive. The view, applied to itself, asserts the possibility of its own fallibility, but it does not assert its own refutation.</p><p>Putting the question of coherence aside, there are two primary ways of pushing back against the argument I gave above. One is to revise what is meant by <em>certainty</em> in such a way that being certain that p does not entail that p is true, rejecting the first premise of my argument. This strategy could work, but it would necessitate such a transformation in our common-sense understanding of the way the word "certainty" is used that I don't think it's worth pursuing.</p><p>The second way of pushing back is to revise or reject <em>realism,</em> specifically, its claim of <em>independence,</em> in order to reject the second premise of my argument. Many philosophers do reject <em>independence.</em> Berkeley, for example, famously claims that <em><a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/#2>all the world is in the mind</a>.</em> And other philosophers make the same assertion, which enables some of them to say that we have direct epistemic access to the world and so we can't be wrong about it.</p><p>In response to this strategy, I'd like to first reiterate that I'm not a realist about all domains, and so there may be some cases, such as the case of self-knowledge, which I mentioned above, where rejecting realism as stated is plausible. This would imply that certainty about such a domain may be possible — or, more accurately, that it is at least not ruled out by my argument.</p><p>When it comes to domains that I am a realist about, however, such as the external world, history, physics, math, and so on, this objection does not trouble me. The main reason it doesn't trouble me is that I find it wildly implausible for <em>independence</em> to be false. Rejecting <em>independence,</em> as far as I can tell, implies denying that there is anything outside my own thoughts and perceptions at all. Some philosophers, of course, have defended this view, but, while I acknowledge that there is a debate worth having, this is not the venue to pursue such reflections. Here, I take <em>independence</em> as a given. And so, my belief in premise two stands.</p><h2>Humility</h2><p>I would like to close with an observation about human psychology.</p><p>In recent years, I have been stunned to see so many people who seem to hold their opinions in such confidence that they believe there is no possibility whatever that they could be wrong. Such certainty in one's beliefs frightens me. It frightens me because, in my view, confidence to this extreme is likely to lead to misery.</p><p>In considering any practical question about what to do, in order to know what to do — that is, in order to know what actions or which policies would produce the best outcome — one needs to know the truth about the matter in question, or, at least, to come close to the truth. But gross levels of confidence prevent one from getting close to the truth since they make one unwilling to revise one's beliefs in the light of new evidence. They make one unwilling to admit new evidence into one's deliberations because one thinks one already has all the answers. Indeed, in my experience, I have often found such confidence to be indicative of ignorance for this very reason.</p><p>The argument I have given above, if successful and if they would hear it, should induce sobriety among people with such confidence. I have argued that everyone is in principle fallible about any realist domain. What follows from this argument, if it is to be believed, is that certainty about any realist domain is impossible. All that can be achieved is confidence in one's beliefs.</p><p>I want to caution that these reflections do not entail that one should become intellectually unmoored, losing confidence about all one's beliefs. Nor do they entail that one should doubt the advance of scientific knowledge or the efficacy of vaccines, for example. I also do not mean to suggest that one should hold her beliefs in abeyance indefinitely, or raise the required level of confidence for action in any particular domain to something unreachable — in the course of life, one must eventually make one's best judgement, decide, and act. What these reflections do entail is that one should bring a degree of humility to her epistemic considerations. There is a degree of humility that respects the epistemological situation one finds herself in but which does not prevent due confidence in one's beliefs.</p><p>I am urging one to give up on the fiction of certainty, but not on independent truth. In one's epistemic considerations, even if certainty in it may always elude one's grasp, the aim of truth is the only one worth having.</p></div><aside class=aside-post-container><div class="aside-post left"></div><div class="aside-post right"><a href=/articles/2021-09-09-error-handling-in-go-rest-apis.html><p class=aside-post-arrow>Older &#8594;</p><p class=aside-post-title>Error Handling in Go REST APIs</p></a></div></aside></article></main><footer><span>© 2022.

In this post, I’ll talk about how server side rendering works and the implementation that I developed.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>In traditional web applications, web pages are rendered on the client side. The browser receives a blob of JavaScript from the server, processes it, and paints the UI that the user sees. In server rendered applications, on the other hand, the first render of a web page is done on the server. The browser receives a pre-rendered page, which it can display without running any JavaScript. This enables better SEO exposure, since many web crawlers cannot run JavaScript, and faster perceived page load times.</p><p>There are also some downsides to server side rendering. These include slower server response time and, in lower bandwidth environments, slower time to interactive. For apps that run behind login screens, whose content is private, these downsides might make server side rendering less than worthwhile. For our use case, however, the benefits well outweigh the costs. Most of our app’s pages are public facing, so exposure to web crawlers is essential.</p><h2>Preliminary Considerations</h2><p>Implementing server side rendering is not a trivial task. In response to this fact, a number of libraries have emerged to make implementation a bit easier. These include Next.js, Razzle, numerous boilerplates, and others.</p><p>These libraries and frameworks can be a good choice for rapidly prototyping a feature or when starting a new app, but I would not recommend them for use in production or for extant apps. The reason for this is that using them requires surrendering a large portion of your codebase to them, which makes debugging and optimization more difficult, if not impossible, and makes you ignorant of how your app is really working. What’s more, integrating such a framework into an extant application is often more trouble than it’s worth.</p><p>Therefore, I developed a custom implementation of server side rendering at Meural. I hope that our stack is similar enough to that of other companies so that other developers might find this article useful. Our frontend uses React, React Router 3, and Redux, while our backend is a monolithic Django application.</p><h2>The High-Level View</h2><p>At a high level, setting up server side rendering consists in setting up the following chain of events.</p><p><img src=/images/ssr.jpg alt="SSR Schema"></p><p>Since our primary application server is a Django application, which cannot understand JavaScript, we need a JavaScript runtime to render our React frontend. For this, we’ll use a Node server. When a request hits our primary Django server, we’ll query our database to get the info we need. Next we’ll send that info in an HTTP <code>POST</code> request to our Node server, which will return our markup, plus the final state of our Redux store. Finally, we’ll embed this information into the HTML response of our Django app and send it to the client.</p><h2>Node-Django Interaction</h2><p>Let’s begin by setting up the Node server. I decided to use Express.js because it is battle-tested and very easy to use. Note that we are reading our <code>NODE_HOST</code> and <code>NODE_PORT</code> variables from our runtime environment.</p><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><span style=color:#6272a4>// server.js

</pre><p>The first thing the <code>render</code> function does is configure the Redux store. I used the same <code>configureStore</code> function that I had already defined in following the usual Redux API pattern.</p><p>The second thing the <code>render</code> function does is get the frontend routes of my React app, by calling a function I wrote called <code>getRoutes</code>. This function takes the Redux store as an argument and returns all of the routes to my app. It prevents code duplication because I can call it in both server and browser environments (See the <em>Handling the Client Side</em> section below to see how it is used in a browser environment).</p><p>The name <code>getRoutes</code>, though accurate, is somewhat incomplete. The function does not just get routes. It also gets the React components of which my app is composed, since they are embedded in the definitions of the routes themselves. Therefore, the <code>getRoutes</code> function is what links my existing React app to the render function.</p><p>Next, in order for the <code>render</code> function to match the desired route, I use React Router’s <code>match</code> function. This function’s first argument is an object containing all of my app’s routes as its first key — which we have from the <code>getRoutes</code> function — and the desired route as the second key. The match function’s second argument is a callback that gets evoked after matching is complete. In a successful matching, this callback’s third argument is a <code>renderProps</code> object. These <code>renderProps</code> represent the state of my app’s props at a given route. I pass this object into React-Router’s <code>&lt;RouterContext></code> component (which is a static version of its more familiar <code>&lt;Router></code> component) to render the state of our app at the matched route.</p><p>To give the components of my app access to the Redux store, I wrap the <code>&lt;RouterContext></code> component with the <code>&lt;Provider></code> component from the React-Redux library.</p><p>Next, I call <code>ReactDOMServer#renderToString</code> with this wrapped component as its argument to render the state of my application at the matched route to HTML.</p><p>Finally, I call <code>getState</code> on my Redux store to extract its final state in case the rendering process changed anything.</p><p>If the match function fails to match the desired route, the second argument of its callback is a <code>redirectLocation</code> argument. In this case, I recursively call the <code>render</code> function with this new desired route. I am confident that there will never be a chain of infinite redirects because I have defined a wildcard route to handle such cases.</p><h2>Calling the Render Function</h2><p>The render function will not work as it is currently defined. The reason for this is that the JSX used in the function itself, as well as in the rest of my app, is not understood in Node runtimes. Therefore, I use Webpack and Babel to transpile my <code>render.jsx</code> file into Node compliant code. All I had to do to make this work was to copy my existing webpack config, change the entry point to <code>render.jsx</code>, and replace the target parameter with <code>target: ‘node’</code>.</p><p>When transpiling, I ran into some errors. Since this version of my React app will not be running in the browser, window and document will not be defined. Therefore, I had to move all references to <code>window</code> and <code>document</code> to functions that are executed only after the DOM is accessible. This involved moving references to <code>window</code> and <code>document</code> from methods like <code>Component#constructor</code> to methods like <code>Component#componentDidMount</code>. Unlike <code>Component#constructor</code>, <code>Component#componentDidMount</code> will only be called after the component has been mounted to the DOM. I also had to abandon some third-party libraries that relied on <code>window</code> or <code>document</code> in problematic places.</p><h2>Handling the Client Side</h2><p>Now that my server responds with a fully rendered page of my app, I need to adjust my client side JS to expect this. Here’s the code I wrote.</p><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><span style=color:#6272a4>// entry.js

</pre><p>You might have noticed that I added an <code>async</code> attribute to my script tag in <code>base.html</code>. The <code>async</code> attribute makes the tag non-render-blocking, which means that the browser won’t wait for the entire script to download before rendering. This produces a considerable speed increase, especially with large JavaScript bundles. However, it also means that it is possible for the script to be executed at any time during the load process, which means that the standard procedure of waiting for <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> before rendering with ReactDOM might not always work, since <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> might have already fired, in which case, the React app would never get executed and the page would never become interactive. Therefore, I check the <code>document.readyState</code> when the bundle is initially executed. If the <code>readyState</code> is <code>complete</code> or <code>interactive</code>, I initialize my React app right away. Otherwise, I add listener for <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> and use my initialize function as the callback.</p><p>In my <code>initializeApp</code> function, I get the current state of the Redux store from the window and pass it into <code>configureStore</code> to setup Redux. Next, I match the current route, just as I did on the server side, using the same <code>getRoutes</code> and <code>match</code> functions which I discussed above. Instead of calling <code>ReactDOM#render</code>, which is the usual pattern in client rendered apps, I call <code>ReactDOM#hydrate</code>, which sets up React’s virtual DOM and installs listeners to make the page interactive.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Since deploying this project, we have seen much better SEO at Meural. Now a Google search for the terms <code>meural</code> and some artist’s name will yield a result of that artist’s page or one of her playlists, if that artist is in our collection. Prior to this deployment, this was not possible, since we had exposed only one webpage, which contained our single-page React app.</p></div></article><article><div class=article-header><h1 class=article-title><a href=/articles/2016-05-21-from-philosophy-to-cs.html>From Philosophy to Computer Science</a></h1><span class=article-date>21 May 2016</span></div><div><p><div class="fixed-img-spreader fifty"><div class=fixed-img-setter><img src=/images/philosophy.jpg alt="The thinker" class=fixed-img></div></div></p><p>When I say that I’m a software developer with a background in academic philosophy, many people react with surprise, as if I had jumped between completely divergent fields. Philosophy and computer science are in fact closely related and it is easy to transition from one to the other. In this article I would like to highlight a few reasons why this is so, with the hopes of dispelling the common misperception that they are opposites and of giving some background for students of philosophy who are interested in transitioning to computer science.</p><h2>Logical Similarities</h2><p>The basis of both philosophy and computer science is logic. In philosophy, it’s often used to evaluate arguments, whereas in computer science, it is the means by which the processor is given instructions. Having a good grasp of logic’s core concepts is essential to do well in either.</p><p>Consider this example to see what I mean. Suppose I say,</p><blockquote><p>If Trump or Hillary wins, then all is lost.</p></blockquote><p>This statement can be represented in philosophical notation as follows:</p><pre><code>(1) (A ∨ B) → C
</code></pre><p>where <code>A</code> is "Trump wins", <code>B</code> is "Hillary wins", <code>C</code> is "All is lost," and <code>∨</code> and <code>→</code> are shorthand for "or" and "If … then …," respectively.</p><p>Now let’s write a simple program that captures the content of our claim. Let’s make our computer print "All is lost," if either Hillary or Trump win, and print "Not all is lost," if neither of them wins.</p><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><span style=color:#ff79c6>if</span> trump_wins <span style=color:#ff79c6>||</span> hillary_wins
    <span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>print</span> <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;All is lost.&#34;</span>
<span style=color:#ff79c6>else</span>
    <span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>print</span> <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;Not all is lost.&#34;</span>
<span style=color:#ff79c6>end</span>
</pre><p>Cool. If we run this program after the election, it will print "All is lost," or "Not all is lost," depending on the result. Notice that, as far as the logic is concerned, we’ve used the exact same concepts that we used in expressing (1). The only difference is <em>syntax</em>. Here, the <code>→</code> is represented as a multi-line command and <code>∨</code> is represented as <code>||</code>. The other addition that we’ve made is to add an imperative, namely, <code>print</code>. This is one of the main differences between pure logic and programming: Computers do things in the physical world; pure logic does not.</p><p>The advantage of a background in philosophy is that you are already able to translate colloquial statements into logical formulae, just as programmers do. As a student of philosophy, moreover, this kind of knowledge allows you to craft and criticize arguments. As a computer programmer, the same knowledge enables you to see several ways of building the same program; and the ability to see the far reaching, logical entailments of your claims often makes it easier to spot bugs.</p><h2>Analytical Similarities</h2><p>The way that one evaluates a philosophical position is surprisingly similar to the way a computer processor evaluates code. Both involve analytically determining what follows from what.</p><p>Consider the position of utilitarianism. According to this view,</p><blockquote><p>What is good is what maximizes happiness. The virtuous choice is the one that maximizes happiness.</p></blockquote><p>In order to evaluate this position, we need to consider its implications and ask if they are sound. If there is an unsound consequence, then the following logic will undermine the position. Schematically, where <code>¬</code> is 'not,' <code>A</code> is "What is good is what maximizes happiness," and <code>B</code> is some unsound consequence, we have:</p><pre><code>Assume:            A → B
Assume:            A
By Modus Ponens:   B
Assume:           ¬B
By Modus Tollens: ¬A ∎
</code></pre><p>This argument shows that, if there is some unsound consequence <code>B</code>, then <code>A</code> cannot be true.</p><p>In computer programming, the style of thinking involved is remarkably similar. Suppose you are writing a computer program that plays chess and you need to write a function that checks the board to see if there is a checkmate. You might start out with something like this:</p><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36><span style=color:#ff79c6>def</span> <span style=color:#50fa7b>checkmate?</span>
  <span style=color:#ff79c6>if</span> current_player<span style=color:#ff79c6>.</span>king<span style=color:#ff79c6>.</span>is_capturable?
    <span style=color:#ff79c6>return</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>true</span>
  <span style=color:#ff79c6>else</span>
    <span style=color:#ff79c6>return</span> <span style=color:#ff79c6>false</span>
  <span style=color:#ff79c6>end</span>
<span style=color:#ff79c6>end</span>
</pre><p>This function checks to see if the current player's king can be captured. If it is, it returns <code>true</code>; otherwise, it returns <code>false</code>.</p><p>In order to evaluate this code, we perform a <em>mental stack trace</em>, that is, we imagine, as best we can, how the computer will process the code that we have just written. If our code is successful, all checkmated boards will be identified; otherwise, they won't be. Similarly, in the philosophical case, we evaluate our position by imagining all possible entailments. If our position is successful, we'll agree with all of the entailments; otherwise, we won't.</p><p>As it turns out, both of these cases are deficient. The problem with utilitarianism (at least in its current crude form) is that it ends up implying that slavery is not wrong, on the grounds that the intense suffering of the few may result in the highest levels of happiness for the many. This is unacceptable, so the argument above obtains. Analogously, the checkmate function will misidentify checked boards as being checkmated. The fact that the current player's king can be captured just means that she must move her king out of check, not that its capture is inevitable.</p><p>The point, however, is that both computer programming and philosophy involve analytically determining the consequences of one's statements; and both necessitate a certain creativity in subsequently modifying one's statements accordingly.</p><h2>Historical Development</h2><p>Besides these concrete similarities, academic philosophy played a fascinating role in the historical development of computing.</p><p>The conceptual work that made the advent of modern computing possible took place in the early seventeen hundreds, when the philosopher and mathematician G.W.Leibniz developed an algebraic logic. In this logic, ones and zeros represent true or false states. The reason this is significant is that Leibniz’s ones and zeros would later be rendered mechanically as on or off switches in the first primitive computers. Although it took several hundred more years and the work of countless other philosophers, mathematicians, and engineers to develop our modern notion of computing, its conceptual foundation can be traced back to Leibniz’s philosophical logic.</p><p>The influence of philosophy on computer science did not stop at Leibniz, however. In the early nineteen hundreds, the philosophers Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, a nearly 2,000 page book written largely in formal logic that aimed to couch all of mathematics in terms of logic. Although the primary aim of this book was later demonstrated to be impossible by Gödel, the <em>Principia</em> also set out a theory of types that was later put to use by computer scientists. According to Constable’s brief history, Russell and Whitehead’s theory of types</p><blockquote><p>…provided a basis for both a precise semantics and elegant programming logics. It was in this context that computer scientists and logicians created the type theories that are deeply connected to <em>Principia Mathematica</em> and serve now as comprehensive logical accounts of computing, computational mathematics, and programming logics (<a href=https://www.srcf.ucam.org/principia/files/rc.pdf>Constable</a> 3).</p></blockquote><p>Today the influence of philosophy on computer science continues, especially in the ares of artificial intelligence, the representation of information, language, and other things.</p></div></article><article><div class=article-header><h1 class=article-title><a href=/articles/2016-04-17-ski-free.html>SkiFree</a></h1><span class=article-date>17 April 2016</span></div><div><p>Here's a clone of the classic game SkiFree that I made with Javascript Canvas as part of a/A's curriculum.

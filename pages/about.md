title: About
---
I’m a software engineer based in New York City. I currently work at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and previously worked at [Meural](https://www.meural.com). I learned to code at [a/A](https://appacademy.io/) and pursued analytic philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/) and [N.Y.U.](https://as.nyu.edu/philosophy.html) before that.

This blog is where I put my published writing and other opinions about things that interest me. Usually, I like to write about politics, philosophy, and code. My side project is [Linksort](https://linksort.com). You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexanderRichey) or [send me an email](https://quil.la/IHQNK), if you’d like.

All opinions expressed here are my own and don’t reflect anything about the views of my employer or other entities or institutions with which I’m affiliated.

## The Case for Injustice

In Plato's _Republic_, Socrates and Thrasymachus consider whether it is better to be just or unjust. Thrasymachus argues that it is better to be unjust. His position is that one is better off when she does what is in her self-interest, without regard for justice, morality, or the common good. This is so obvious, he believes, that it amounts to "common sense."

Thrasymachus' position is not naive. To make it more concrete, consider the example of taxation. According to Thrasymachus, I am better off when I dodge my taxes than when I pay them, so long as I can get away with it.

One might object to this view by saying that, if enough people do not pay their taxes, then the government could not operate and all of my money and contracts would be invalidated; my personal property would not be secured; and so on and so forth. Therefore, I would actually be worse off.

But Thrasymachus can answer this objection by saying that it misses the point. He is not saying that it is in my interest for _everyone_ to avoid their taxes. Rather, it is in my interest for everyone else to continue paying their taxes and for me to get away without paying them.

Thrasymachus' position, in other words, is not that one should _always_ act unjustly. It is that one should act unjustly only when it is in her interest to do so.

This ancient attitude toward injustice is believed by many people today. In last year's presidential debates, for example, Donald Trump replied to Hilary Clinton's criticism that he has not paid his fair share of taxes by saying,

> That means I'm smart.

This could have been a claim straight out of the mouth of Thrasymachus. For it is consistent with his position that one is better off doing what is in her self interest, even if it is unjust.

## The Case for Justice

I follow Socrates in believing that the position of Thrasymachus is false and that it is better to be just. However, I do not follow Socrates in his arguments. In the _Republic_, Socrates answers Thrasymachus' challenge with a protracted discussion about the notion of an ideal state, the soul, and other things that I and other contemporary people regard with skepticism. I believe that a better argument for justice can be developed by reflecting on the prisoner's dilemma and I would like to sketch out such an argument now.

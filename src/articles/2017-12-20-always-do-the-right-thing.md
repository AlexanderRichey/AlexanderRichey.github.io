One could argue that the genesis of western philosophy occurred when Thrasymachus and Socrates discussed the question of whether one is better off being just or unjust. This question is of great importance, for it is one that everybody implicitly answers through her conduct in life. Should I be good or evil?

Whereas Socrates argues that one is always better off acting justly, Thrasymachus and a chorus of other philosophers argue that injustice is the better strategy. In the next few paragraphs, I want to advance a pragmatic answer to what I am calling Thrasymachus' Challenge, that is, the charge that one is better off acting unjustly. Drawing on developments in game theory, I formulate a Thrasymacian strategy and put it to the test. This strategy is successful in abstract terms. However, the requirements for it to succeed in the real world do not obtain. Justice is the best strategy.

## Thrasymachus' Challenge

Thrasymachus maintains that one is better off when she does what is in her self-interest, without regard for justice, morality, or the common good. This is so obvious, he believes, that it amounts to "common sense."

Thrasymachus' position is not naÃ¯ve. To make it more concrete, consider the duty of taxation. According to Thrasymachus, I am better off when I dodge my taxes than when I pay them, so long as I can get away with it.

One might object to this view by saying that, if enough people do not pay their taxes, then the government could not operate and all of my money and contracts would be invalidated; my personal property would not be secured; and so on and so forth. Therefore, I would actually be worse off.

But Thrasymachus can answer this objection by saying that it misses the point. He is not saying that it is in my interest for _everyone_ to avoid their taxes. Rather, it is in my interest for everyone else to continue paying their taxes and for me to get away without paying them.

Thrasymachus' position, moreover, is not that one should _always_ act unjustly. It is that one should act unjustly only when it is in her interest to do so.

This ancient attitude toward injustice is believed by many people today. In last year's presidential debates, for example, Donald Trump replied to Hilary Clinton's criticism that he has not paid his fair share of taxes by saying,

> That means I'm smart.

This could have been a claim straight out of the mouth of Thrasymachus. For it is consistent with his position that one is better off doing what is in her self-interest, even if it is unjust.

## Something

I follow Socrates in believing that the position of Thrasymachus is false and that it is better to be just. However, I do not follow Socrates in his reasoning. In the _Republic_, Socrates answers Thrasymachus' challenge with a protracted discussion about the nature of the state, the soul, and other things that I and other contemporary people regard with skepticism. I believe that a better argument for justice can be developed by reflecting on the prisoner's dilemma and I would like to sketch out such an argument now.

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

The prisoner's dilemma is a simple game where two players must choose to either cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, they both receive a score of R for "reward". If they both defect, they both receive a score of P, for "punishment". If one player cooperates and the other defects, then the defector receives a score of T for "temptation" and the cooperator receives a score of S for "sucker".

The following condition must hold among the numerical values assigned to each score.
```
T > R > P > S
```
In English, _Temptation_ beats _Reward_, which beats _Punishment_, which beats _Sucking_.

This game is represented in the following table, with 6, 4, 2, and 0 assigned to T, R, P, and S, respectively.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Cooperate</th>
    <th>Defect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cooperate</th>
    <td>4, 4 (R, R)</td>
    <td>0, 6 (S, T)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Defect</th>
    <td>6, 0 (T, S)</td>
    <td>2, 2 (P, P)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

title: On Looting

It is in one’s interest to follow the law when one is also protected by the law. But if one is not protected by the law, then what interest does one have in following it?

For example, it is in my interest to follow the law by abstaining from stealing from others because, in return, others will not steal from me. The law enforces this, such that, if someone does steal from me anyway, then she will be punished and, if possible, my property will be returned to me. This is, roughly speaking, the way the social contract, as expressed by [many western philosophers](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism-contemporary/), is to function. We give up certain freedoms (my freedom to acquire the property of someone else by force) in exchange for certain protections (the security of my property) that are enforced by the state.

But what if the law is not equally enforced? What if, for some groups of people, they do not receive the protection of the law, despite their abiding by it? What if, in other words, the social contact is breached, in that the enforcers of the law do not deliver its protections?

In such a state of affairs, would it be so wrong to disobey the laws regarding petty theft as a mode of [civil disobedience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/)? Or would it be a useful expression of what has truly gone wrong, which is that the agreement of the social contact is not being upheld?

I condemn looting not because it is philosophically unsound, but rather because, as a form of civil disobedience whose intent is to produce political change, it is strategically ineffective. There are other forms of civil disobedience—such as those taken up by the [Boston Tea Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party), [Susan B. Anthony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony), and [Rosa Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks)—that more effectively persuade onlookers to take up the cause of reform and which are not susceptible to the objections of anarchy and nihilism that looting is.

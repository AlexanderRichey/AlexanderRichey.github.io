title: About
---
I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I currently work at [Amazon Web Services](https://buildon.aws/) and previously worked at [Meural](https://www.meural.com). I learned to code at [a/A](https://appacademy.io/) and pursued analytic philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/) and [N.Y.U.](https://as.nyu.edu/philosophy.html) before that.

This blog is mainly a repository for my published writing, which is usually about politics, philosophy, and code. My side project is [Convo](https://hiconvo.com), an alternative to Facebook for private events.

All opinions expressed here are my own and don't reflect anything about the views of my employer or other entities or institutions with which I'm affiliated.

I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I currently work at [Amazon Web Services](https://buildon.aws/) and previously worked at [Meural](https://www.meural.com). I learned to code at [a/A](https://appacademy.io/) and pursued analytic philosophy at [Columbia](http://philosophy.columbia.edu/) and [N.Y.U.](https://as.nyu.edu/philosophy.html) before that.

This blog is mainly a repository for my published writing, which is usually about politics, philosophy, and code. You can also check out some of my web development work in my [portfolio](http://dev.alexrichey.com).
